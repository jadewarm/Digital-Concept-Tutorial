Each letter of the English alphabet corresponds with a number one through twenty-six.  
A is the first letter, so it corresponds with 1. 
B is the second letter, so it corresponds with 2. 
Z is the twenty-sixth letter, so it corresponds with 26. 
To say a word in binary, each letter needs to be represented by the number it corresponds with. 

The word HELLO has the eighth letter, the fifth letter, the twelfth letter, the twelfth letter again, and the fifteenth letter. Each of those numbers can be made using the binary system that was taught in the last two sections.  

The number eight in binary is 1000.  
The number five in binary is 0101.  
The number twelve in binary is 1100.  
The number fifteen in binary is 1111.  

Then, just put those binary numbers in line.
1000 0101 1100 1100 1111 is HELLO in binary code.
