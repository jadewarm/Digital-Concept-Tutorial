Unlike the English alphabet, binary code is read from right to left.  
Each 1 or 0 represents a 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, etc. This is easy to remember because the number starts at one and is multiplied by two each time.  

Let's take a look at a number like 0011. Consider 1 as on and 0 as off. So, starting from the right, we have on, on, off, off.  
Counting from the right, the first 1 represents one. The second 1 represents two. The first 0 equals four, and the second 0 equals 8.  
All the numbers represented by each 1 get added together. In this example, the 1s are on the one and two slot, so they add together to make a total of three.
