For this second example, we will use the binary number 1011. 
__Remember,__ binary is read from right to left!
1 can be considered on and 0 can be considered off.  

The first space represents one.  
The second space represents two.  
The third space represents four, but since it is off, it does not get counted.  
The fourth space represents eight. 

When you add one, two, and eight together, the answer is eleven. So, eleven is 1011 in binary.
